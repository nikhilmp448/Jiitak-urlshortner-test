# AI TOOLS USED 
## Chat Gptv3
i have iused chat gpt for my react actualy i'm a backend developer with little knowledge in react so chat gpt helped me to route my Api as expected 

one of the major benifits of chat gpt for me i think it will help developer to work on any domain easily which he/she have a basic knowledge in progroming then they could easly work on any domain or any stack on whatever projects are comming for a company without regecting it 

eventhough i had worked in java for a project in a company for 6 month without having a previous knowledge in java

but the drowback of GPT is it is outdated so if we follow compleatly chat gpt you will face lots of issues like dependency version error something like that on your project 

i prefer Chatgpt over Bard because of code quality and well defined
